Faults and Conflicts

° Localization of faults in models

— E.g., Use statistical models for normal behavior; identify and trace
variables that cause adverse and anomalous events

° Conflicts in cooperation of CPS

— E.g., Employ and check metadata to handle conflicts of actuating
the same physical entity in different ways

° Conflicts in specifications when CPS evolve

— E.g., Versioning and linking of engineering artifacts to cope
with multiple heterogeneous engineering domains
