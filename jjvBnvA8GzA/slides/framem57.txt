Modeling, Testing and Verification

- Uncertainty in CPS is multi—faceted

— E.g., Framework for uncertainty based on fuzzy logic taking into
account component input, output, behavior and composition

° High-level application requirements vs resource-
Iimited microcontrollers

— E.g., Expose "components" as services in resource-limited
microcontrollers
