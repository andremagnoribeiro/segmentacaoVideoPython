Modeling, Testing and Verification

° Demands on tools and techniques for

verification and validation of CPS

— Trial—and-error testing (state of the practice) does not provide
sufficient rigor in error detection

— Formal methods provide a desired level of expressiveness but
are neither intuitive nor efficient

— Existing simulation tools are limited in their capabilities to jointly
model physical and cyber components
