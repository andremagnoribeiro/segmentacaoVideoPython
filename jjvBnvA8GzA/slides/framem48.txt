Modeling Challenges

° Today’s model-based CPS approaches have

various problems:

— Difficult to integrate the different modeling approaches

— Difficult to make trade-offs and ensure
consistency/completeness

- Difficult to integrate humans “in the loop”

° Proposed approach:

— Unified representation through extensions of software
architecture and use of architectural views

— Tools for dependency analysis and coordination
— Stochastic multi-player games
