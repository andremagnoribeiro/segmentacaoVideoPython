Collaboration

0 Additional functionality in the X‘
interplay of constituents of CPS

— E.g., Document and analyze systems on an
instance level to support automated verification
at design time and adaptation at runtime ‘ l K

0 Inherent heterogeneity and distribution of CPS

— Scalability and robustness calls for decentralized approaches

   

— E.g., Domain specific modeling language with code generation
and runtime environment that supports integration logic
