Pragmatic and Systematic Engineering

' Can we leverage ”smartness" to obtain high quality
systems?

— The system may have some flaws, as long as it has smartness
allowing the system to recover or repair itself

- Can we derive models that are inherently compose-able?

— To support open-endedness and evolution of CPS

— Based on component ”premises, " the ”connectors” could
account for consistency, timing, security, etc.

- Need for seamless integration of design and runtime

— Improve design-time techniques and make them accessible to
domain experts

— Support run-time monitoring and adaptation
