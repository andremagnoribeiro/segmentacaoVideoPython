What are Cyber Physical Systems?

”Engineered systems that are built from, and depend
upon, the seamless integration of computational and
physical components” [NSF]

‘(II- I ”‘2:
”Embedded computers and
networks monitor and
control the physical ~—
processes, usually with
feedback loops where
physical processes affect

computations and vice
versa. ” [Lee 2008]
