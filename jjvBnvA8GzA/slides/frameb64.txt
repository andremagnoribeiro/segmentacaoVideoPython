Collaboration

0 Additional functionality in the

interplay of constituents of CPS
— E.g., Document and analyze systems on an
instance level to support automated verification
at design time and adaptation at runtime
0 Inherent heterogeneity and distribution of CPS

— Scalability and robustness calls for decentralized approaches

   

— E.g., Domain specific modeling language with code generation
and runtime environment that supports integration logic
