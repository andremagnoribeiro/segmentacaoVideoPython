Software Engineering for Smart Cyber
Physical Systems Workshop (SEsCPS)

' Goals

— Increase the understanding of problems ofSE for
sCPS

— Study the underlying foundational principles for
engineering sCPS

- E.g., Reasoning about uncertainty, dealing with
emergent behavior, distributed control

— Identify promising SE solutions for sCPS
- E.g., Models, engineering processes, integrated V&V
